# Loan_Approval_Prediction-Decision_tree

This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict loan approvals using a **Decision Tree Classifier**. The dataset contains information about applicants and whether their loan was approved or not. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the loan status based on input features.

## 🚀 How to Run
- Clone this repository.

- Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
- Open the notebook:

```bash

jupyter notebook "Loan Prediction - decision tree.ipynb"

```

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The performance of the Decision Tree model is evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score - 76%
- Precision - 0.79

- Confusion Matrix

- Train-test split validation

---
## 📌 Future Improvements
