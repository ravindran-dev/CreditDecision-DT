# CredictDecision - Decision Tree

This project demonstrates a machine learning approach to predict loan approvals using a **Decision Tree Classifier**. The dataset contains information about applicants and whether their loan was approved or not. The goal is to create a model that can accurately predict the loan status based on input features.



## Project Structure
Loan Prediction - decision tree.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the full implementation of data loading, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using a Decision Tree.

Dataset: Assumed to be included or imported within the notebook (e.g., train.csv, test.csv from Loan Prediction datasets like those on Kaggle).


## Technologies Used

- Python

- Jupyter Notebook

- Scikit-learn

- Pandas

- NumPy

- Matplotlib / Seaborn (if used for visualization)
  

## Features
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical variables)

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Feature selection

- Model training using Decision Tree Classifier

- Model evaluation with accuracy score, confusion matrix, etc.
  

## How to Run
- Clone this repository.

- Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
- Open the notebook:

```bash

jupyter notebook "Loan Prediction - decision tree.ipynb"

```
- Run all cells step-by-step.

## Model Evaluation
The performance of the Decision Tree model is evaluated using:

- Accuracy Score - 76%
- Precision - 0.79

- Confusion Matrix

- Train-test split validation


## Future Improvements
- Use of other classifiers like Random Forest, XGBoost for comparison.

- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

- Deployment of the model using a web interface (e.g., Streamlit or Flask).

## Dataset
- Ensure the loan prediction dataset (commonly available via platforms like Kaggle) is available in the working directory.
